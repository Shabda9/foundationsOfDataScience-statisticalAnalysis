## Overview:
This project aims to analyze the provided datasets using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The objective is to investigate various aspects of the data and present findings in a high-quality presentation. The assessment includes two descriptive statistical analyses and two inferential statistical analyses based on the datasets provided.

## Datasets:
We were provided three datasets with descriptions as:

### 1. `dataset1.csv`:
This dataset contains basic demographic information of more than 120,000 adolescent respondents, each identified by a unique ID number. The key variables include:
- `ID`: A unique number identifying a respondent.
- `gender`: Self-reported gender (1 for male and 0 otherwise).
- `minority`: 0 for majority ethnic group; 1 otherwise.
- `deprived`: 1 for residing in areas with high deprivation indices; 0 otherwise.

### 2. `dataset2.csv`:
This dataset captures the daily digital screen time of approximately 113,000 respondents (a subset of dataset1.csv). The variables include:
- `ID`: A unique number identifying a respondent.
- `C_we`: Number of hours using computers per day on weekends.
- `C_wk`: Number of hours using computers per day on weekdays.
- `G_we`: Number of hours playing video games per day on weekends.
- `G_wk`: Number of hours playing video games per day on weekdays.
- `S_we`: Number of hours using a smartphone per day on weekends.
- `S_wk`: Number of hours using a smartphone per day on weekdays.
- `T_we`: Number of hours watching TV per day on weekends.
- `T_wk`: Number of hours watching TV per day on weekdays.

### 3. `dataset3.csv`:
This dataset contains self-reported well-being indicators from 102,580 respondents (a subset of dataset2.csv). Variables include:
- `ID`: A unique number identifying a respondent.
- `Optm`: Feeling optimistic about the future.
- `Usef`: Feeling useful.
- `Relx`: Feeling relaxed.
- `Intp`: Feeling interested in other people.
- `Engs`: Having the energy to spare.
- `Dealpr`: Dealing with problems well.
- `Thkclr`: Thinking clearly.

- `Conf`: Feeling confident.
- `Mkmind`: Ability to make up one's mind about things.
- `Loved`: Feeling loved.
- `Intthg`: Being interested in new things.
- `Cheer`: Feeling cheerful.

These well-being indicators were scored on a scale from 1 to 5, representing:
1 – None of the time,
2 – Rarely,
3 – Some of the time,
4 – Often,
5 – All of the time.

## Methodology:
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: 
   - Summary statistics 
   - Data visualizations (pie charts, bar graphs)

2. **Inferential Analysis**:
   - T test
   - Corrolation analysis

## Tools and Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)
- VS code
